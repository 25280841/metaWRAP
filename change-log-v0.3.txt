metaWRAP v=0.3 (November 2017)

General:
	Error handling is greatly improved throughout the pipelines by incorporating the $? error code instead of relying on output files
	Disabled PHYLOSIFT module (this software is too old)
	Temporarily disabled ALL module due to increased complexity of the metaWRAP pipeline

ReadQC module:
	Fixed issue with program thinking READQC did not finish correctly

Assembly module:
	Removed joint assembly feature. Now you can only assemble with metaSPAdes OR Megahit.
	(megahit is defualt due to its speed)
	Changed minimum contig length from 500bp to 1000bp
	
Binning module:
	This module is now split into four parts for modularity:
	Binning module: this module is a basic wrapper around existing binning software (but conviniently handles intermediate files)
		You can now bin with metaBAT2 and/or MaxBin2 and/or CONCOCT
		Pipeline now calculates library insert sizes on the fly (and correctly)
		Samtools tmp files bug fix
		Samtools sort -m memory option fixes
	Bin_refinement: this module consolidats all possible binning version of the bins from the Binning module
		Runs CheckM on binning iterations
		Produces the best possible bins
		Allows user to input the minimum desired completion and maximum contamination
		No longer quits if there are too many bins to plot
	Bin_reassembly: this modules takes a set of metagenomic reads, alignes them back to the bins, and uses those reads to reassemble them
		The reassembly function as a whole is now 100+ times faster than before due to paralelization
		The read filtering for each bin is now parallelized into the same BWA alignment operation
		The reassembly itself is not parallelized into 1 thread operations for each bin, which ends up being much faster
	Quant_bins:
		This module takes in (non-reassembled) bins and reads from many samples, and estimates the abundance of each bin in each sample with salmon
		The process is paralelized and the alignment time does not scale with number of bins
	

Blobology module:
	Allows for paralel processing of multiple read sets (but one assembly). Produces one figure per sample, with colors being consistant.
	Changed annotations to blobplot file when the --bins option is selected - added additional columns
	Now makes multiple bin annotation plots, annotating bins and their taxonomy
	Blastn does not re-run if there is an output file with the same name already in the output folder



Future plans:
-incorporate bracken
-figure out a better replacement for phylosift
-allow ALL module to take in multiple samples at once
-allow ALL module to take in parameters for its submodules
