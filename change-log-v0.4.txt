metaWRAP v=0.4

General:

ReadQC module:
	Major bug fix that prevented bmtagger from filtering out human reads when the read names in the fastq had spaces
	Module now exits if the provided fastq files do not exist

Assembly module:
	
Binning module: this module is a basic wrapper around existing binning software (but conviniently handles intermediate files)

Bin_refinement: this module consolidats all possible binning version of the bins from the Binning module
	removed depricated requirement for prviding reads as input
	major bug fit to prevent HMMER to run out of space in /tmp/ by providing a new tmp folder
	bug fix: bin consolidation script now supports contigs in any naming format

Bin_reassembly: this modules takes a set of metagenomic reads, alignes them back to the bins, and uses those reads to reassemble them
	removed spades parallelization due to strange signmentation fault errors...
	majob bug fix of bug preventing recruiting of reads for reassembly if the read names had spaces in them
	major bug fit to prevent HMMER to run out of space in /tmp/ by providing a new tmp folder
	
Quant_bins:	

Blobology module:



Future plans:
-paralelize human/microbe read splitting after bmtagger
-allow bin_refinement module to take in 4 bin sets
-add --run_checkm option to binning module
-wrap MetaWatt into binning module (aparently really good for complex data)
-wrap MyCC (completely different concept for binning, good for few samples)
-incorporate bracken
-figure out a better replacement for phylosift
-allow ALL module to take in multiple samples at once
-allow ALL module to take in parameters for its submodules
