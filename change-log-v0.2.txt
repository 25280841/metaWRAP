metaWRAP v=0.2
General:
	Added compatibility with long input parameters (eg. --options asdf) with getopt instead of getopts
	Chenged instalation style of metaWRAP so that the contents of bin needs to be added to PATH to run. The user still needs to edit the config file first
	Changed name of contig.sh to config-metawrap so be more distinguishable in PATH
	All modules are now called through the master "metaWRAP" script (including the ALL module)
	Changed heirarchy of pipeline scripts. Now they are hidden away in a "pipelines" folder, and only metaWRAP is visible
	Changed the commenting system to be done through a python script that writes out pretty comments
	New module: Phylosift. Currently all it does is randomly subsamples reads and runs Phylosift on them

ReadQC module:
	Added --skip-bmtagger option (reduces runtime signifficantly)
	Added --skip-trimming option
	Added --skip-pre-qc-report option
	Added --skip-post-qc-report option

Assembly module:
	Added --only-metaspades option (for those who dont like the idea of double assembly)
	Added --only-megahit option (signifficantly reduces resourse requirements and time)

Binning module:
	Added --skip-checkm option (reduces runtime)
	New feature where bins that are >20% completion and <10% contamination are placed into a new folder - "good bins"
	Added --checkm-good-bins option, to allow making a checkm figure for only good bins (makes a prettier figure)
	Added --skip-reassembly option (reduces runtime signifficantly)
	New feature where after reassembly the best variant of each bin (original, strict, or permissive reassemblies) is placed into a new folder - "best bins"
	Added --checkm-best-bins option, to allow re-making the checkm figure on only the best versions of each bin
	Removed KRAKEN from the binning module. KRAKEN now has to be run seperately on the output bins
	Not also returns the average and stdev of insert lengths for each sample - useful for library assessment

Blobology module:
	Added --bins option, which allows to annotate the blobplot with bins from a binning folder

ALL module:
	Major bug fixes and improvements
	Added a Phylosift and Kraken on bins steps to pipeline
	All output figures and reports are now saved to "metaWRAP_figures" folder at the end of the pipeline
	Added --fast option, which skips some non-essential and computationally expensive parts of the pipeline
